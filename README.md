# Exploring Hacker News Posts
Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts - Python For Data Science: Intermediate 


A data analysis guided project by [DataQuest](www.dataquest.io), in which we are analysing the posts from the popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) where the user sumbitted storis are voted and commented upon. From the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), we are interested in the posts that begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN` titles. The dataset has already been cleaned,sorted and reduced to approx. 20,000 rows. 

* When a user submits a `Ask HN` post, user posts a specific question to the Hacker News community
* When a user submits a `Show HN` post, it typically shows the Hacker News community a product, project or something interesting.



In this project we will be analysing the following: 

1. Which post receives more comments on an average, `Ask HN` or `Show HN`?
1. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
